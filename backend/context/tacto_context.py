ACCOUNT_CONTEXT = """
ACCOUNT: Tacto GmbH
HEADQUARTERS: Munich, Germany
INDUSTRY: AI-driven procurement software for manufacturing and mid-sized industrial firms
ANNUAL VALUE AT RISK: ~€1.8 M / year (≈ €450 K per quarter)
KEY CONTACT: Alex Worbs (Head of Strategic Procurement Solutions)

ABOUT THE COMPANY:
Tacto provides an AI platform that automates supplier discovery, ESG due-diligence, and cost analytics for industrial buyers.
Their clients are manufacturing firms in DACH and Northern Europe; they rely on our components and integration services
to build predictive data pipelines and dashboards for procurement teams.

PAYMENT TERMS HISTORY:
- 04 Sep 2025 kickoff call: Alex requested Net 30 with 2 % early-payment incentive.
- Finance offered Net 45 standard or Net 30 conditional on quarterly volume pre-commitments.
- Agreement (verbal, not signed): Net 45 through Q4 2025; revisit in January 2026 once annual contracts renew.
- Alex internally communicates Net 30 as "approved in principle", so expectations may diverge.

DELIVERY / INTEGRATION HISTORY:
- We supply containerized micro-services used in their data-normalization pipeline.
- 22 Sep 2025: Version 2.3 deployment delayed two days due to missing license key;
  Tacto’s QA automation failed as a result.
- 25 Sep 2025: Post-mortem call — Alex said: "Predictability beats speed; just tell me early."
- 10 Oct 2025: We introduced pre-release staging notifications, reducing last-minute fire-drills.
- 14 Oct 2025: Alex emailed: "This is the first week I didn’t have to chase anyone. Keep it that way."

RELATIONSHIP HEALTH:
- Status: Green → light yellow (operational trust good, schedule trust recovering).
- Strategic alignment remains strong; they mention us in investor materials as an automation partner.
- Renewal risk: low in Q4 2025, but contingent on maintaining SLA transparency.
- Upside: additional €600 K ARR if we secure the 2026 data-lake co-development deal.

COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES (Alex Worbs):
- Values precision and timestamps: "Tell me when, not what you’re thinking about."
- Prefers concise bullet summaries via email or Slack; long explanations lose attention.
- Hates vague status lines like "we’re looking into it"—expects explicit ETA or next check-in time.
- Best window: 09:00 – 11:30 CET (before leadership syncs); avoid 14:00 – 16:00 CET when they demo to clients.

WHAT’S AT STAKE:
- Missing a single go-live milestone risks them labeling us "not enterprise-grade" in 2026 evaluations.
- Success means formal reference status in their marketing (huge reputational win for us).
- Alex personally championed our selection; if we embarrass him in front of his COO, he will protect his credibility first.

HOW TO HANDLE FIRST CONVERSATION AS NEW ACCOUNT OWNER:
1. Do **not** open with "I’m new and catching up"—they expect continuity, not onboarding.
2. Open with: "Confirming the 2.4 release schedule and making sure our Tuesday staging alert reached your QA team."
3. Demonstrate process control: "You’ll receive a 09:00 CET status update every day of rollout week."
4. Mention reliability, not apology: "Predictability beats speed—I’m keeping that front of mind."
5. End with a next commitment: "Next sync Thursday 09:15 CET unless there’s a blocker sooner."

RED FLAGS TO WATCH:
- Phrases like "enterprise-grade readiness" or "vendor maturity" = they’re benchmarking alternatives.
- Repeated dashboard complaints = internal pressure from Alex’s COO about data visibility.
- If they copy their VP Engineering on routine emails, trust is slipping.
