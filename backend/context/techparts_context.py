ACCOUNT_CONTEXT = """
ACCOUNT: TechParts GmbH
ANNUAL VALUE AT RISK: ~€1.6M/year (≈€400K per quarter)
KEY CONTACT: Martin Vogel (Purchasing Lead)

PAYMENT TERMS HISTORY:
- 12 Sept 2025 call: Martin requested Net 30.
- We pushed back: cannot do < Net 45 without CFO signoff.
- Verbal agreement: Net 45 accepted for now, but no signed amendment.
- Martin still believes Net 30 is "under discussion" and expects us to "revisit before Q1 2026."

LOGISTICS / ESCALATION:
- PO-442 was late twice (5-day slip each time).
- On 9 Oct 2025, Martin said: "We can't keep explaining delays to our downstream customer."
- We offered a €7.2K credit note and promised guaranteed Thursday dispatch windows going forward.
- Sensitivity: If we miss Thursday again, he threatened to move "half the line" to competitor Altus Components in January.

RELATIONSHIP HEALTH:
- Status: Yellow (recoverable but fragile).
- Trust dropped end of September when they had to apologize downstream.
- Tone improved after credit note + dispatch guarantee.
- Renewal risk: Medium. Q4 volume not locked if we slip again.

COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES (Martin Vogel):
- Hates long apology emails. Says "spare me backstory."
- Wants status first, fix second, apology last.
- Gets annoyed if we say "logistics backlog." Treats that as excuse.
- Prefers phone 16:30-18:00 CET after his production meeting, not morning.
- He responds well to "here is the lane we opened for you" (specific action).

WHAT'S AT STAKE:
- Q4 renewal ≈€420K. If he actually moves half of that to Altus Components in Jan, we lose ~€210K/quarter.
- His internal story to his bosses is: "These guys finally stabilized dispatch, we pressured them and it worked." We break that story if we slip.

HOW TO HANDLE FIRST CONVERSATION AS NEW ACCOUNT OWNER:
1. Do NOT open with "I'm new, catching up." That forces him to repeat his pain.
2. Open with: "I'm calling to confirm Thursday dispatch is holding and to make sure Net 45 is still workable for you."
3. Show you already know the pain: "I know PO-442 was ugly for you in September, and I don't want a repeat."
4. Close with: "If anything slips even 24h, I will call you first — you won't have to chase us."

RED FLAGS TO WATCH:
- If Martin mentions 'Altus Components' casually, it's a warning shot.
- If he reopens Net 30 immediately, he's testing leverage.
- If he repeats 'we keep explaining this to our customer,' he's escalating and expects a concession (discount / credit).
