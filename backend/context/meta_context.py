ACCOUNT_CONTEXT = """
ACCOUNT: Tacto
ANNUAL VALUE AT RISK: ~€2.1M/year (≈€525K per quarter)
KEY CONTACT: Alex Worbs (Strategic Partnerships / Procurement Ops)

PAYMENT TERMS HISTORY:
- 03 Oct 2025 call: Alex pushed for Net 30 with a 2% early payment discount structure.
- Our finance team said we can only guarantee Net 45 standard, OR Net 30 if volume commitment increases in Q1.
- Interim alignment: Net 45 remains in force for Q4 2025, no formal concession signed yet.
- Alex is positioning Net 30 internally as "already basically agreed," even though it is not documented.

SUPPLY / DELIVERY EXPECTATIONS:
- Tacto is less angry about lateness than TechParts, but more strict about forecast reliability.
- They operate on tight rollout windows tied to their enterprise demos / pilots.
- On 16 Oct 2025, Alex said: "If you say Tuesday, it has to be Tuesday. It can't slide to Wednesday morning without telling me."
- They care about proactive comms, not post-hoc apologies.
- They asked for a single point of truth dashboard for order status — current blocker is we still send updates across 3 different email threads.

RELATIONSHIP HEALTH:
- Status: Green turning Yellow.
- Trust is good at leadership level (they see us as a partner, not just a vendor).
- Friction is operational: "stop making me chase basic status updates."
- Renewal risk: Low for now, but they explicitly tied expansion to "confidence in your process, not hero fixes."

GROWTH / UPSIDE:
- Alex is actively lobbying internally to make us their default supplier for a new rollout line in Q2 2026.
- That expansion is ~€800K upside annually if it lands.
- They’re using our stability as part of their pitch to their own execs — if we look sloppy, Alex loses political capital.
- Alex said on 21 Oct 2025: "I can sell you up, but only if I don't get surprised in front of my COO again."

COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES (Alex Worbs):
- Hates fluff. Wants status + next action, bullet format. No paragraphs.
- Prefers async first. Do NOT call without slacking/emailing first unless it's truly on-fire.
- Gets annoyed if you say "we're looking into it" with no timestamp for next update.
- Wants one source of truth per workstream, not scattered updates across CC lists.
- Best window: 09:00-11:30 CET. After lunch they're usually in partner calls.

WHAT'S AT STAKE:
- Immediate downside: if we keep making them chase us for ETAs, they'll escalate this as "supplier not enterprise-ready."
- Long-term upside: we are in position to land their Q2 2026 rollout (~€800K/year new revenue) IF they feel we run like an adult vendor.
- Political detail: Alex is personally on the hook for "we chose a supplier we can trust operationally." If we embarrass them in front of their COO again, they will protect themselves first.

HOW TO HANDLE FIRST CONVERSATION AS NEW ACCOUNT OWNER:
1. Do NOT introduce yourself with "I'm new and just getting up to speed." That makes Alex think they have to onboard you from scratch.
2. Open with: "I'm consolidating all delivery/status comms into a single thread so you never have to chase us again."
3. Acknowledge their pain specifically: "You shouldn't be surprised in front of your COO. That’s on us, and I'm fixing it."
4. Tell them what you're doing next, with timing: "You'll get Tuesday 09:00 status summaries from me, even if there's no change."
5. Ask for escalation rules, not for a recap of history: they hate repeating themselves.

RED FLAGS TO WATCH:
- If Alex says anything like "I need to be able to trust you in front of my COO," that's not small talk — it's escalation.
- If they mention "we're evaluating vendor readiness," that means procurement is already looking at alternates for 2026 rollout.
- If they start asking about dashboards again in a frustrated tone, it's a signal that they are getting pressure from above and you are about to slip from 'strategic partner' to 'risk item' on an exec slide.
