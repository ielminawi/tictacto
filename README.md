# galactacto

A collection of utilities for processing PDFs and generating interactive visualizations and videos using OpenAI APIs.

## Projects

### 1. Knowledge Graph Generator (kg4.py)
Extracts a simple knowledge graph from a PDF using the OpenAI Responses API, builds a NetworkX graph, and renders an interactive visualization as HTML.

**What kg4.py does:**
- Uploads a PDF to the OpenAI Files API and asks the model to extract entities and relations into a typed Pydantic schema.
- Builds a MultiDiGraph (NetworkX) from the extracted entities and relations (keeps evidence and page numbers).
- Exports graph files (out/kg.graphml and out/kg.gexf).
- Renders an interactive HTML visualization (knowledge_graph.html) using pyvis and opens it in your browser.

**Outputs:**
- knowledge_graph.html — interactive visualization (saved to repo root and opened automatically).
- out/kg.graphml, out/kg.gexf — graph exports.
- Optionally out/kg_<timestamp>.json if saving raw parsed output.

### 2. Instagram Reel Generator (reels.py) 🎬
**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This script contains HARDCODED PROMPTS and is designed for direct PDF-to-video generation.**

Generates 15-second Instagram Reels directly from PDF content using OpenAI's Sora video generation API.

**What reels.py does:**
- Extracts key information from PDFs (focuses on persons, companies, and their relations)
- Creates a single optimized video prompt for 15-second Instagram Reels
- Generates a direct video using Sora API (vertical format, 1080x1920)
- Creates a simple HTML preview with video player

**Key Features:**
- **15-second maximum duration** - Optimized for Instagram Reels
- **Direct PDF to video** - No intermediate script generation
- **Vertical format** - Instagram Reels optimized (9:16 aspect ratio)
- **Single video output** - One `direct_sora_reel.mp4` file

**⚠️ HARDCODED PROMPTS:**
The script contains hardcoded video generation prompts and may not work with all PDF content types. The prompts are optimized for business/company content with persons and relationships.

**Outputs:**
- `direct_sora_reel.mp4` - The generated 15-second video
- `video_prompt.txt` - The prompt used for Sora
- `reel_preview.html` - Simple preview page

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install openai networkx pyvis pydantic
  ```
- For reels.py video generation:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements_reels.txt
  ```

## Configuration
- Provide an OpenAI API key. The scripts currently accept an OpenAI client creation call; prefer setting an environment variable and updating the scripts to read it:
  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
  ```
- **Remove any hardcoded API keys before committing.**

## Run

### Knowledge Graph Generator
1. Place the PDF you want to process (default in script: `pdf_test2.pdf`) next to the script or update `PDF_PATH`.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python3 kg4.py
   ```
3. The script will create `knowledge_graph.html` and open it in your default browser.

### Instagram Reel Generator
1. Place the PDF you want to process (default: `pdf_test2.pdf`) next to the script.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python3 reels.py
   ```
3. The script will generate a 15-second video and open a preview in your browser.

## Notes
- The repo .gitignore is configured so only `kg4.py`, `knowledge_graph.html`, and `.gitignore` are kept at the root — other files are ignored.
- **reels.py contains hardcoded prompts** - may need customization for different content types.
- Inspect and sanitize any saved JSON outputs before sharing (may contain extracted text).
- Video generation requires OpenAI Sora API access.
# 🧠 TicTacTo  
### *“Never lose context again — across accounts, teams, or time.”*

---

## 🚀 Overview
**TicTacTo** is an AI-powered shared brain for organizations.  
It captures every conversation, document, and insight across **clients, suppliers, and internal teams**, and makes them instantly searchable and conversational.

When someone leaves the company, the relationships don’t reset — the memory stays.

> **“Because relationships shouldn’t restart when people do.”**

---

## ✨ Core Idea
Most organizations lose up to **80% of relationship context** when handovers happen — missed commitments, lost trust, and repeated conversations.  

**TicTacTo** solves that by combining:
1. **Layer 1 — Ingestion (Context Builder)**  
   - Takes raw emails, call transcripts, and notes.  
   - Uses OpenAI to generate structured `{company}_context.py` files (relationship briefs).  

2. **Layer 2 — Q&A Runtime**  
   - Loads the correct company memory file.  
   - Answers any question about that relationship using only stored context.  
   - Powers the conversational interface you see in the demo.

## ⚙️ Setup & Run

### 1️⃣ Create and activate the virtual environment
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv tic_venv
source tic_venv/bin/activate        # (Mac/Linux)
# or
tic_venv\Scripts\activate           # (Windows)
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Add your API key
Create `.env` inside `backend/`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx
```

### 4️⃣ Run the backend
From the **project root (`tictacto`)**:
```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 5️⃣ Test the API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{"question":"What did we agree on payment terms?","company_id":"techparts"}'
```

Expected:
```json
{"answer": "Payment terms are Net 45 ... Why this matters: misalignment may risk renewal."}
```

---

## 🧩 API Contract

**POST** `/ask`  
**Body:**
```json
{
  "question": "string",
  "company_id": "string"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "string"
}
```

---

## 🖥️ Frontend (Lovable)

The Lovable interface consists of:
- **Left Column:** Account Summary (health, risk, key contacts)  
- **Right Column:** Chat with Relationship Memory  
- **Buttons:**  
  - **Brief Me:** Opens a short summary drawer  
  - **Play Reel:** Opens a 30 s visual recap of the relationship

All content is grounded in the same `ACCOUNT_CONTEXT` file used by the backend.

## 🌍 Vision
**Short-term:** Smooth account handovers, zero lost context.  
**Mid-term:** One memory layer for *all* organizational knowledge — accounts, internal docs, and market insights.  
**Long-term:** A true **“Relationship Operating System”** for companies — memory that never resets.

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt
> “What did we agree on payment terms?”  
> → *“Verbal Net 45 agreement with Martin Vogel; he still believes Net 30 is pending. Why this matters: unmet expectations could damage trust and renewal.”*
